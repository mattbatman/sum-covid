        This data is from the CDC's <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home">COVID Tracker Data</a> as of August 19, 2021. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html">According to the CDC</a>, it "includes deaths reported by state, local, and territorial health departments. Reporting frequency might vary by
        jurisdiction. This reflects the most up-to-date information received by CDC based on preliminary reporting." These counts are since January 21, 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the case fatility rate ("CFR") reflects deaths as a percentage of cases. It does not attempt to factor for every person who has had COVID-19.

        This data is from the CDC's
        <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cdc.gov/vbim-akqf">COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data API</a>,
        last updated on August 4, 2021. The CDC's case surveillance data has about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>ths of
        the cases as what it reports via the COVID Tracker Data. The case fatality rate ("CFR") was calculated as
        the deaths in the age group divided by the number of cases in that age group. The survival rate is the number of
        cases that did not result in a death, or "1 minus the death rate."
