        as of September 26, 2021. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html">According to the CDC</a>,
        it "includes deaths reported by state, local, and territorial health departments. Reporting frequency might vary by
        jurisdiction. This reflects the most up-to-date information received by CDC based on preliminary reporting." These totals are since January 21, 2020.

      <p>
        Note that the case fatility rate ("CFR") reflects deaths as a percentage of cases. It does not attempt to factor for every person who has had COVID-19 (such as the untested and undiagnosed).

        cases that did not result in a death, or "1 minus the death rate."
