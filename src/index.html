        as of October 3, 2021. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html">According to the CDC</a>,
        it "includes deaths reported by state, local, and territorial health departments. Reporting frequency might vary by
        jurisdiction. This reflects the most up-to-date information received by CDC based on preliminary reporting." These totals are since January 21, 2020.

      <p>
        Note that the case fatility rate ("CFR") reflects deaths as a percentage of cases. It does not attempt to factor for every person who has had COVID-19 (such as the untested and undiagnosed).

        last updated on September 9, 2021, and has data from 29,851,450 cases. The case fatality rate ("CFR") was calculated as

        cases that did not result in a death, or "1 minus the death rate."

      <h2>Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)</h2>
      <p>
        The data for the graph below was exported from the CDC WONDER system
        of VAERS data. The dataset includes all data processed as of September 17,
        2021. It was downloaded on September 27, 2021.
      </p>
      <p>The graph below displays total deaths reported to VAERS by year for any vaccine.
        To replicate the data for deaths,
        <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html">visit the request system</a>,
        agree to terms at the bottom, click "VAERS Data Search" in the middle of
        the page, group results by Year Reported, ensure "The United States/Territories/Unknown"
        is selected in step 4, and select "Death" as the Event Category in step 5. However,
        the data for all charts was generated by selecting "Event Category" and by "Year Reported"
        in step 1. The CDC WONDER system for VAERS data will display a table, and
        only exports to a `.txt` file.

        The stats below also come from the CDC WONDER system of VAERS data. They only include reports from
        "The United States/Territories/Unknown" in step 4, and therefore exclude reports from the rest of the world on
        the COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by US companies.

        To get the stats below for reported events from the COVID-19 vaccines, select "Event Category" in step 1, and "+ COVID19 (COVID19 VACCINE)" in step 3.
