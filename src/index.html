        Note that the case fatility rate ("CFR") reflects deaths as a percentage of cases. It does not attempt to factor for every person who has had COVID-19 (such as the untested and undiagnosed).

      <h2>Body Mass Index and COVID-19 Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
        On March 8, 2021, the CDC published a
        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7010e4-H.pdf">
          <i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i>
        </a> with data from PHD-SR ("a large, hospital-based, all-payer database")
        containing data on COVID-19 patient outcomes and Body Mass Index (BMI).
        The pool of people selected for the CDC's study included 3,242,649
        people 18 years or older who had their height and weight documented
        while receiving emergency deparment or inpatient care in 2020. Of those,
        148,494 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        The graph below shows the number of patients from the study that were
        diagnosed with COVID-19 ("Cases"), the number of patients diagnosed with
        COVID-19 who were hospitalized ("Hospitalized"), and the number of patients
        diagnosed with COVID-19 who died ("Death"), grouped by their BMI classification
        ("Underweight", "Healthy Weight", "Obesity", and "Severe Obesity").
